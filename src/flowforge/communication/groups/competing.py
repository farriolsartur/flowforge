    Competing distribution sends DATA messages to only one consumer
    (selected by strategy), while ERROR and END_OF_STREAM messages
    are sent to ALL consumers. This implements load balancing.

    Strategies:
        - ROUND_ROBIN: Rotate through channels sequentially
        - RANDOM: Select a random channel for each message

    Attributes:
        _channels: List of output channels to distribute to.
        _strategy: How to select the next channel for DATA.
        _current_index: Current position for round-robin (0-indexed).
        _name: Optional name for debugging.

    Example:
        >>> group = CompetingChannelGroup(
        ...     channels=[ch1, ch2],
        ...     strategy=CompetingStrategy.ROUND_ROBIN,
