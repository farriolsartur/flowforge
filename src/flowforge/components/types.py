    """Base class for components that produce data.

    DataProviders are "triggerable" components - they have a run() method
    that the Engine calls to start data generation. They support graceful
    shutdown via the request_stop() method.

    DataProviders use SenderMixin to send messages to downstream components.

    Subclasses must implement:
        - run(): The main execution loop that generates data

    The run() implementation should:
        1. Generate and send data via send_data()
        2. Periodically check _stop_requested
        3. Call send_end_of_stream() before returning

    Attributes:
        _stop_requested: Flag indicating shutdown was requested.

    Example:
        >>> class CounterProvider(DataProvider[CounterConfig]):
        ...     async def run(self):
        ...         for i in range(self.config.count):

    Algorithms receive messages from upstream components via their
