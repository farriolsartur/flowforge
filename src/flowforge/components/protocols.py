"""FlowForge component protocols defining component capabilities.

This module defines the protocols that describe what components can do.
The actual component base classes and mixins are in separate modules
(base.py, mixins.py) and will be implemented in Phase 2.

class Triggerable(Protocol):
    """Protocol for components that need to be started by the Engine.

    Triggerable components have a `run()` method that starts their
    main execution loop. Examples include DataProviders that generate
    data and need to be explicitly started.

    The protocol also supports graceful shutdown via `request_stop()`,
    which sets `_stop_requested`. The `run()` implementation should
    periodically check this flag and exit cleanly when True, sending
    END_OF_STREAM before returning.

    Example:
        class MyDataProvider(DataProvider[MyConfig]):
            async def run(self) -> None:
                while not self._stop_requested:
                    data = await self.generate_data()
                    await self.send_data(data)
                await self.send_end_of_stream()
    """

    _stop_requested: bool

        4. Return cleanly (don't raise on stop request)
