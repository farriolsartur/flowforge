    Components are the building blocks of FlowForge pipelines. Each component
    has a name and a typed configuration. Components support lifecycle hooks
    for initialization and cleanup.

    The configuration type is extracted from the generic parameter at class
    definition time. If no configuration is specified, EmptyConfig is used.

    Attributes:
        name: Unique identifier for this component instance.
        config: The component's configuration (validated Pydantic model).

    Example:
        >>> class MyConfig(BaseModel):
        ...     threshold: float = 0.5
        ...
        >>> class MyAlgorithm(Algorithm[MyConfig]):

        ...         if message.payload["value"] > self.config.threshold:
        ...             await self.process(message)

    Lifecycle Hooks:
        - on_start(): Called after wiring, before pipeline starts processing.
                      Use for resource initialization (DB connections, files).
        - on_stop(): Called during graceful shutdown after processing ends.
                     Use for resource cleanup.
